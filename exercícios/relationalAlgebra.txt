Query 1. Retrieve the name and address of all employees who
work for the ‘Research’ departmen.

RESEARCH_DEPT <= sigma dname='Research' (DEPARTMENT)
RESEARCH_EMPS <= (RESEARCH_DEPT join Dnumber=Dno EMPLOYEE)
RESULT <= pi fname, lname, address (RESEARCH_EMPS)


Query 2. For every project located in ‘Stafford’, list the
project number, the controlling department number, and the
department manager’s last name, address, and birth date. 

STAFFORD_PROJ <= sigma plocation='Stafford' (PROJECT)
STAFFORD_PROJ_DEPT <= (DEPARTMENT join dnumber=dnum STAFFORD_PROJ)
PROJ_DEPS_MGRS <= (STAFFORD_PROJ_DEPT join mrgssn=ssn EMPLOYEE)
RESULT <= pi pnumber, dnumber, lname, address, bdate (PROJ_DEPS_MGRS)


Query 3. Find the names of employees who work on all the
projects controlled by department number 5

DEPT5_PROJECTS <= rho pno (pi pnumber (sigma dnum=5 (PROJECT)))
EMP_PROJS <= rho ssn, pno (pi essn, pno (WORKS_ON))
RESULT_EMP_SSNS <= EMP_PROJS div DEPT5_PROJECTS
RESULT <= pi fname, lname (EMP_PROJS join EMPLOYEE)


Query 4. Make a list of project numbers for projects that
involve an employee whose last name is ‘Smith’, either as a
worker or as a manager of the department that controls the
project.

EMP_SMITH <= pi ssn(sigma lname='Smith' (EMPLOYEE))
DEPTS <= rho dnum, ssn (pi dnumber, mgr_ssn (DEPARTMENT))
DEPTS_MGR_SMITH <= DEPTS div EMP_SMITH
- PROJS_DEP_MGR_SMITH <= rho pno (pi pnumber (PROJECT div DEPTS_MGR_SMITH))
PROJS <= rho ssn, pno (pi essn, pno (WORKS_ON))
- PROJS_SMITH <= PROJS div EMP_SMITH
RESULT <= PROJS_SMITH U PROJS_DEP_MGR_SMITH

-- Using joins:
EMP_SMITH <= pi ssn(sigma lname='Smith' (EMPLOYEE))
SMITH_PROJS <= pi pno (WORKS_ON join essn=ssn EMP_SMITH)
DEPTS <= rho dnum, ssn (pi dnumber, mgr_ssn (DEPARTMENT))
DEPTS_MGR_SMITH <= rho dnum (pi dnumber (DEPTS * EMP_SMITH))
PROJS_MGR_SMITH <= rho pno (pi pnumber (PROJECT * DEPTS_MGR_SMITH))
RESULT <= SMITH_PROJS U PROJS_MGR_SMITH


Query 5. List the names of all employees with two or more
dependents.

DEPEN <= pi essn, dependent_name (DEPENDENT)
QTD_DEPENDENT <= essn F COUNT dependent_name (depen)
EMP_MORE_THAN_2_DEPENDENTS <= sigma count_dependent_name>2 (QTD_DEPENDENT)
RESULT <= pi fname (EMP_MORE_THAN_2_DEPENDENTS join essn=ssn EMPLOYEE)


Query 6. Retrieve the names of employees who have no dependents.

SSN_WITH_DEPENDENT(ssn) <= pi essn DEPENDENT
EMP_WITH_DEPENDENT <= EMPLOYEE * SSN_WITH_DEPENDENT
EMP_WITHOUT_DEPENDENT <= EMPLOYEE - EMP_WITH_DEPENDENT
RESULT <= pi fname (EMP_WITHOUT_DEPENDENT)


Query 7. List the names of managers who have at least one dependent.

MGR_SSN (ssn) <= pi mgr_ssn (DEPARTMENT)
SSN_HAVE_DEPENDENT (ssn) <= pi essn (DEPENDENT)
MGR_HAVE_DEPENDENT <= MGR_SSN intersec SSN_HAVE_DEPENDENT
RESULT <= pi fname (MGR_HAVE_DEPENDENT * EMPLOYEE)
